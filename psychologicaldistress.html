            Psychological distress refers to non-specific symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression, and it is more common in women.
            Women reported more psychological distress than men. Loneliness, job dissatisfaction and family-work conflict were associated with the largest risk of psychological distress. 
            Having children, active participation, being able to successfully combine work and family roles, and social support are found to be protective factors.

        Poverty, domestic isolation, powerlessness (resulting, for example, from low levels of education and economic dependence),
        and patriarchal oppression are all associated with higher prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in women.

          <strong >Journaling</strong><br>It's therapeutic to write down thoughts because it helps 
          people express their emotions in a more tangible way. As a result, ideas no longer circle in one's mind and doing this 
          will mentally benefit the individual. Writing becomes a substitute for talking to someone and expressing thoughts.

          <strong>Alone Time</strong> <br>One of the primary reasons impacting women's mental health might be due to lack of self-care.
          It can be challenging to find alone time, yet it is essential for resetting emotions. 
          Additionally, one might use this time to assess their lives and determine what is working for them and what is not.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Get Help</strong> <br>There comes a point when it is necessary to be honest with oneself and admit 
          that they require assistance. Perhaps professional help can be obtained to assist one deal with stress and improve their mental health. 
          The bottom line is that every woman should attempt to take breaks whenever they can and seek professional assistance to maintain their 
          overall wellbeing.
