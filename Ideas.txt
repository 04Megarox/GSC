Topic 2: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
   Focus: Target 16.2: Protect children from abuse, exploitation, trafficking and violence
   Working:
        Let's assume that you see a child walking down the street, completely malnourished, shows signs of being abused (i.e physical injuries), paranoid, works long           or excessive hours or is always available “on demand.” All you have to do is snap a picture of him/her and upload it on <app name/website name> along with the         area pincode,state, signs of abuse, estimated age of child. This data will be sent directly to NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, INDIA 
        (website: https://hrcnet.nic.in/HRCNet/public/webcomplaint.aspx). The person would then get an otp on their mobile phone that they would have to enter within a         certain time period so as to submit the incident.
        
        People can view their complain status by clicking on "check file status", this will redirect the person to the following webpage:                         
        "https://www.hrcnet.nic.in/HRCNet/public/SearchComplaint.aspx" where they would have to fill in the details to check the status.
        
        Note: This idea may need some imporvements for smooth or better functioning, so any changes are more than welcome but the changes are to be mentioned in       
        brackets along with the name of the person who updated it.
