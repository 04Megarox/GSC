          The menstrual cycle is the regular natural process that occurs in the female reproductive system.
          It involves a complex interplay of hormones and physiological changes that result in the monthly shedding of the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) through the vagina.
        </p>
      </div>

    <p class="menstrual-para2">
      The menstrual cycle typically lasts between 21 and 35 days, with an average length of 28 days. 
      It can be divided into four phases:
      <ul class="menstrual-para2-items">
        <li>
          <strong>The Menstrual Phase:</strong><br>This phase begins on the first day of menstruation when the uterus sheds its lining. It typically lasts between 3-7 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong >The Follicular Phase: </strong><br>During this phase, the pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the growth of follicles in the ovaries. These follicles contain eggs that will potentially be released during ovulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ovulation:</strong> <br>This is the phase when a mature egg is released from the ovary and travels down the fallopian tube, where it may be fertilized by sperm. Ovulation usually occurs around day 14 of a 28-day cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Luteal Phase:</strong> <br>After ovulation, the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. This hormone prepares the uterus for possible implantation of a fertilized egg. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum disintegrates, and the hormone levels drop, leading to the start of a new menstrual cycle.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="menstrual-para3">
      Keeping track of the menstrual cycle is important for several reasons. 
      It can help predict the timing of ovulation, making it easier to conceive or avoid pregnancy. 
      It can also help identify irregularities in the menstrual cycle, 
      which may be a sign of underlying health issues such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),
      thyroid disorders, 
      or endometriosis.
      <br>
      <br>

      Additionally, tracking the menstrual cycle can help women prepare for their period and manage 
      symptoms such as bloating, cramps, and mood changes. It can also help healthcare providers 
      diagnose and treat menstrual disorders such as heavy or irregular bleeding.
