            Sex education is the provision of information about bodily development, sex, sexuality, and relationships, along with skills-building 
            to help young people communicate about and make informed decisions regarding sex and their sexual health.

      One crucial aspect of sex education in women is the prevention of unwanted pregnancy. 
      The rate of teenage pregnancy has increased drastically in the past few years.According to WHO studies, adopting effective contraceptive methods (condoms, hormonal and emergency contraceptives) can help prevent teenage pregnancies. 
      However, most adolescent girls are either unable to buy contraceptives or are unaware of the ways to use them.
      <ul class="sex-ed-para2-items">
        
        <li>
          <strong >Condoms </strong><br>Condoms are a "barrier" method of contraception. They are made of very thin latex (rubber), polyurethane or polyisoprene and are designed to prevent pregnancy by stopping sperm from meeting an egg. 
          They can also protect against STIs if used correctly during vaginal, anal and oral sex.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hormonal Contraceptives</strong> <br>Hormonal methods of birth control (contraception) contain either estrogen and progestin or progestin only; they are a safe and reliable way to prevent pregnancy for most people. 
          Hormonal methods include an implant, an intrauterine device (IUD), injections, pills, vaginal rings, and skin patches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergency Contaceptives</strong> <br>Emergency contraception refers to methods of contraception 
          that can be used to prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse. These are recommended for use within 5 days but are more effective the sooner 
          they are used after the act of intercourse.Emergency contraceptive pills prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation and they do not induce an abortion. 
          The copper-bearing IUD prevents fertilization by causing a chemical change in sperm and egg before they meet. 
          Emergency contraception cannot interrupt an established pregnancy or harm a developing embryo.

    <p class="sex-ed-para3">
      In most society sexual education is still a taboo. Girls are discouraged to learn or explore their sexuality and other sexual activities.
      They are often misled and fed lies surrounding sex education. Here are few myths surrounding sex ed along with the actual truth.
      <br>
      <br>
      <ul class="sex-ed-para3-items">
        <li>
          <strong>Myth:</strong><br>Sex education programs increase sexual risk behaviours.<br>
          <strong>Truth:</strong><br>There is no evidence that shows that sex education will encourage the children to engage in risky sexual behaviour. 
          On the contrary, these programs will help them take more healthy and responsible decisions in their sex lives.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Myth:</strong><br>Comprehensive programs increase the frequency of sexual intercourse.<br>
            <strong>Truth:</strong><br>There is no proof of this. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence that such programs had often had often delayed the initiation of the participant to sexual intercourse. 
            Often these programs had led to sexually active young adults to stick with one partner and reduce the frequency of changing partners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Myth:</strong><br>Comprehensive sexuality education is not effective, abstinence-only is.<br>
            <strong>Truth:</strong><br>Abstinence-only sex education programs are less effective than comprehensive sex education approaches.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Myth:</strong><br>Sex education is likely to increase the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies<br>
            <strong>Truth:</strong><br> Studies have shown that teenagers who do not have sex education are unlikely to use 
            condoms if they have sexual intercourse, whereas with sex education the chances of using condoms and avoiding pregnancies are much higher.
